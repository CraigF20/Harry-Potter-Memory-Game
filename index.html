        Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital near Bristol, and grew up in Gloucestershire in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, in south-east Wales.
      </p>
      <p class="personal-info">
        Her father, Peter, was an aircraft engineer at the Rolls Royce factory in Bristol and her mother, Anne, was a science technician in the Chemistry department at Wyedean Comprehensive, where Jo herself went to school. Anne was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Jo was a teenager and died in 1990, before the Harry Potter books were published.  Jo also has a younger sister, Di.
      </p>
      <p class="personal-info">
        The young Jo grew up surrounded by books. “I lived for books,’’ she has said. “I was your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles and National Health spectacles.”

      <h3 class="films"><strong>Film Facts:</strong></h3>
        <ul class="film-facts">
          <li>The kids in the cast had to get casts of their teeth made. Daniel Radcliffe revealed in a new interview, that the younger kids had to get casts of their teeth made so they could get a fake tooth put in case they lost one while shooting. "'Cause you've got a set full of twenty 10-year-olds... they would cast everyone's mouths."</li>
          <li>The scenes at 4 Privet Drive were originally shot on an actual street with real houses. They shot in a real house in a community called Picket Post Close. But they ended up having to build identical model houses because they didn't have access to the house for reshoots.</li>    
          <li>Every letter to Harry were actually hand written — TWICE. The first batch of Hogwarts acceptance letters the graphics team hand wrote for the movie turned out to be too heavy for the owls to carry, which meant that they had to individually hand write thousands of them all over again!</li> 
          <li>The trio's reaction to the great hall was real. The cast hadn't seen the great hall prior to shooting the sorting hat scene</li>      
          <li>J.K. Rowling could have played Harry's mom. She was offered the role of Lily Potter in the Mirror of Erised scene, but she turned it down and the role went to Geraldine Somerville instead.</li>  
          <li>Rupert Grint has an actual severe case of arachnophobia. So he didn't have to do much acting in the scene where he and Harry meet Aragog.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="books"><strong>Book Facts:</strong></h3>
        <ul class="book-facts">
          <li>J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter have the same birthday, which is July 31.</li>
          <li>Dumbledore has a deeper meaning. It’s actually an Old English word for “bumblebee.” Rowling has said that she chose that name because she always thought of Dumbledore humming to himself.</li>    
          <li>Rowling eventually revealed the fate of Dolores Umbridge, although we didn’t read about it in the books: she was eventually imprisoned for her actions at the Ministry of Magic and was sent to Azkaban.</li> 
          <li>Rowling credits the Harry Potter books to her mother’s death, saying the books have a major death theme in them because she started writing them six months before her mother died. She has said that if she didn’t die, there wouldn’t be a Harry Potter.</li>      
          <li>Although Hogwarts is in England and Harry lived in London, much of the series is inspired by Edinburgh, Scotland, which is where Rowling lives.</li>  
          <li>The Dementors were based off of Rowling’s experience with depression. She once described it as “that cold absence of feeling—that really hollowed out feeling. That’s what Dementors are.”</li>

          displaying of Harry Potter and for anyone who is interested to play a small memory 
          game. There is some hope that there are some facts that you dont know. Hope you enjoy the
