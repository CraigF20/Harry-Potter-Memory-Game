          I have put this site together as I enjoy the films and books as well as the universe around Harry Potter, I have been watching the films since I was little and growing up with the films has been great. It is a universe that will immerse the viewer and will engulf you if you read the books as it allows for more depth than the films can produce. Some points within the books are left out from the films so I would recommend reading the books then watch the films. However, this isn't key to enjoying the fantasy that is Harry Potter.

          Now, however you enjoy Harry Potter, it is good to see you on the site and to know that you are a fellow fan of Harry Potter. Overall the site is designed to give the user more information on the brains behind the series of books as well as the films. Of course, it is a small site and doesn't include all the possible information to give, to do that there would need to be a lot of pages and different facts to digest. So I decided to pick out the interesting facts the everyday light fan may not know. I pulled the information on J.K. Rowling from her own website which you can easily check out to get more information on the genius behind the books, early life and what got her to where she is today. Well worth looking at and showing that site some love.

          I have enjoyed piecing this site together and it has taken a while to get to where it is. Mainly due to the Memory Game element, when initially trying to make a game I was beaten by the mechanics of it due to my understanding of it overall. With a bit of research and perserverance it now works, it isn't fantastic or mind blowing but it serves the purpose which is to get the user to remember where the cards are. Alongside that is the information which I believe is key to get a better understanding on the Harry Potter series in general.

            I must give credit for the information I have used on this website to the websites I obtained it from, they are all linked on the home page to where I got them from. These pages were very useful and I would use them again to input more data. Each one has been useful. The images were something that seemed a little more complicated to obtain as I couldn't find any photo that has every cast member, now thats probably down to the fact there are so many cast members to include but nonetheless I managed to find one with a good portion of them.

            The YouTube video was something else, I will be honest I hadn't put one on a site before yet proved to be easy to do which is something I can say I am happy with. It is something that didn't take long to figure out and was easy to implement. When it came to sizing and space it was a relatively quick process. For a first attempt, to me it went okay and it is a process that I would be more than happy to put into another site. It makes sense to include a video containing the films trailers as it may help draw more people in to either watch the films or to read the books.

          Overall colour scheme is designed to be the colours associated with Harry Potter. The colours are what reminds me of the Night Bus which is a personal favourite scene, everything else on the site is designed to tie in with this colour scheme. I chose the typeface based upon what looks like it may be used for Harry Potter and for what I thought would look better, which hopefully these fonts do! I got these fonts from Google Fonts and imported them via this.

          The aesthetic of the site for me is quite pleasing, this page is mainly me talking about the site as you can see, the majority of the content is on the first page which was intended as thats what people first load into. If you have any ideas as to what you would like to see added to the site feel free to use the "Contact Us" page to get an email across as to what you would request I add. Or, if you would rather give me any advice or criticisms on the site in general head over and send an email.

          This is a small paragraph about the website. Its a very basic site mainly for the 
          displaying of Harry Potter and for anyone who is interested to play a small memory 
          game. There is some hope that there are some facts that you dont know. Hope you enjoy the 
          game and the website.
